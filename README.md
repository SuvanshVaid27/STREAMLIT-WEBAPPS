# Streamlit-Webapps

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes and sometimes as a data scientist, we need a platform where we don't want to end up giving more
time to the web development process. This is where Streamlit comes into the picture as it provides the fastest way to build and share data apps. I have been 
able to convert some of my data analysis projects into web apps using Streamlit, as shown below. 


## [Simple NLP app](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/STREAMLIT-WEBAPPS/tree/main/NLP-in-Streamlit)

This is an ongoing project in which I have tried to add simple NLP based functionalities for the user to play with such as word cloud, text summary, etc. I deployed
this project on Heroku to the following link: https://nlp27.herokuapp.com/

A web application designed using Streamlit that trains a machine learning model (a Random forest classifier) on the uploaded dataset and makes predictions. I specifically chose Random Forest model here because it has a lot of hyperparametrs that the user could enjoy tuning. Also, Random Forest is one of the most widely used ML model. The app is deployed on Heroku: https://ml-app27.herokuapp.com/

## [Twitter Scraper](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/STREAMLIT-WEBAPPS/tree/main/Twitter-Scraper-Streamlit)

This application makes use of the tweepy api to scrape tweets in real time and then process them and display them to the user in an interesting word cloud pattern. Although this is just a simple interface built using Streamlit, there are many more potential functionalities that could be added.
